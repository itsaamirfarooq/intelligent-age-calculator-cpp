# Intelligent Age Calculator & Life Stage Classifier (C++)

A modular, OOP-based C++ console application that computes exact age using real-time system date. The program supports multiple date formats, validates leap years, identifies the birth day (via Sakamoto’s Algorithm), and classifies users into life stages.

# Features
- Exact age calculation (years, months, days, total days)
- Birth-day detection using Sakamoto’s algorithm
- Real-time system date integration
- Life stage classification (Baby → Senior)
- Robust input validation for date formats and edge cases
- Leap-year support and Julian Day Number (JDN) for accurate day counts
- Clean OOP architecture (Date, Age, Input, AgeCalculator)

# Technologies
- C++
- <ctime> for system date
- OOP principles and algorithms

# How to Run
Compile with any C++ compiler:

# g++ main.cpp -o agecalc
./agecalc

# Purpose
To demonstrate date handling, algorithmic logic, and OOP design in C++.
